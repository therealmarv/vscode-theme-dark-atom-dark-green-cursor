# Dark Atom Dark Green Cursor Theme

This is a fork of my [Dark Atom Sublime 3 Theme](https://github.com/therealmarv/Atom-Dark.tmTheme) for VSCode.

I compared it with the original Atom editor together with HTML, JS and Python code and it either matches or comes pretty close.

The big eyecandy is the **GREEN** cursor :)

## Recommendations

I recommend using this theme together with the [file-icons icon theme](https://github.com/file-icons/vscode) to complete the experience.

**Enjoy!**
