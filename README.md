# Dark Atom Dark Green Cursor Theme

Most of this theme is based on original Atom editor look and feel.  
However some parts are partially inspired from Monokai theme (like e.g. HTML tags).

The big eyecandy is the **GREEN** cursor :)

If you find errors or have comments feel free to open an [issue on github](https://github.com/therealmarv/vscode-theme-dark-atom-dark-green-cursor/issues) or send me a PR.

I try to improve this theme for more programming languages over time. It is good tested with Python, JS, HTML, JSON, YAML and Markdown.

## Recommendations

I recommend using this theme together with the [file-icons icon theme](https://github.com/file-icons/vscode) to complete the experience.

## History

* Look at `CHANGELOG.MD` for changes.
* This theme is a modified fork of my [Dark Atom Sublime 3 Theme](https://github.com/therealmarv/Atom-Dark.tmTheme) for VSCode.

**Enjoy!**
